# Simple Blog

Simple multi-user blog with features including membership management, comments, tags (with auto-completion), and a few e-mail integrations. This only ever ran on my local system and was written before I knew about not putting secrets in config files that might end up in a public repository. I've removed the properties file, but haven't refactored the app to learn the credentials in another way, so this won't run without some modifications.
